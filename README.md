## Project Description

This project develops a data-driven customer segmentation strategy for AIAI’s airline, shifting from mass marketing to precision engagement. Using historical customer and flight data, it applies a full data mining pipeline, including clustering and profiling, to identify five distinct customer segments across value, behavior, and seasonality dimensions. The insights enable targeted strategies: retaining high-value customers, investing in growth segments, timing campaigns for niche patterns, and reducing costs for low-engagement groups. A financial simulation shows the approach improves marketing efficiency, delivering a projected ROI of 108% within six months, demonstrating both analytical insight and tangible business impact.
